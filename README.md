# Programmering for penetration testing
# pentest-toolbox


# This toolbox is intended to create an automated vulnerability scanning and penetration test tools, using bash and python as programming language in kali linux.


# Tools
- Docker to create an isolated environment
#
 - Metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities
#
- Metasploitable 2 as victim machine
#
- Webserver in localhost as vulnerable webserver
#
- git to pull and push to github and save the project. This way, the pentest-toolbox is accessible everywere. 
#
- Bash and python as programming languages
#
- Scapy module to send and receive packets
#
- subprocess to perform scripting operations, automate tasks and to capture input/output/error
#
- DNSRecon to collect information about domains
#
- Nmap for network exploration, to collect information about ports, services and vulnerabilities
#
- Netstat to collect information about network connection.
#
- Amap to collect information about services and versions running in open ports
#
 - SMBMap to check for Server Message Block vulnerability
#
- Whatweb to collect information about a webserver
#
 - Requests to make HTTP requests (GET)
#
- Nikto to scan and collect information about vulnerabilities in a webserver
#
- John the ripper to crack passwords.


# Steps
In github:
#
1 - Create a Github repository called pentest-toolbox
#
In Kali Linux:
#
1 - Print working directory: pwd
#
2 - Create a Workstation directory: mkdir ws
#
3 - Open/change to ws directory: cd ws
#
4 - Print actual directory: pwd
#
5 - Clone the pentest-toolbox github repository: git clone https://github.com/DrunkV/pentest-toolbox.git
#
6 - List directories and files inside ws directory: ls
#
7 - initiate git inside pentest-toolbox repository: git init
#
8 - Add a title to the README.md file and create the first commit: git commit -m "Added README.md"
#
9 - Create the first push: git push
#
10 - Create a python file to send an ARP request to discover MAC addresses, using scapy library, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 1_network_scan_scapy.py
#
11 - Create a python file to send a ICMP ping, using scapy library, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 2_ping_icmp_scapy.py
#
12 - Create a python file to collect information about domains in the network, using subprocess library and dnsrecon, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 3_dnsrecon_info.py
#
13 - Create a python file to collect information about target´s open ports, using scapy library, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 4_port_scan_scapy_info.py
#
14 - Create a python file to collect information about target´s open ports and running services, using subprocess and nmap, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 5_nmap_scan_info.py
#
15 - Create a python file to collect network information, using subprocess and netstat, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 6_netstat_info.py
#
16 - Create a python file to collect information about running services on open ports, using subprocess and amap, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 7_amap_scan_info.py
#
17 - Create a python file to run a deeper scan and collect information about the target vulnerabilities, using subprocess and nmap, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 8_nmap_deep_scan_info.py
#
18 - Create a python file to run a smbmap vulnerability scan, using subprocess and smbmap, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 9_smbmap_scan_info.py
#
19 - Create a python file to collect information about program versions and services that runs in a website, using subprocess and whatweb, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 10_whatweb_info.py
#
20 - Create a python file to make GET requests to target´s HTTP using requests, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 11_curl_request.py
#
21 - Create a python file to scan for webservers vulnerabilities, using subprocess and nikto, and save the results to the vulnerability_report.txt file: 12_nikto_scan_info.py
#
22 - Create a python script to exploit vsftpd vulnerability to gain shell access, using subprocess. Attack machine was Metasploit and Target machine Metasploitable 2: 14_vsftpd_exploit.py
#
23 - Create a python script to crack passwords, using subprocess and john the ripper: 15_john_hash_crack.py
#
24 - Create a python script to make POST requests to target´s HTTP and add data to the webserver, using subprocess and curl: 16_curl_post.py
#
24 - Check the git status: git status
#
25 - Add the newly created files to git: git add *
#
26 - Create a new commit: commit -m *
#
27 - Push to github: git push
#
